# chinguV12_prework

This is a pre-work project idea for Chingu Voyage 12. This is a functional quasi-clone of Google Fonts.

Tier 1: Implement the basic design layout with information hardcoded. The custom text, dark/light, grid/list, and reset button should work. All information is hardcoded. HTML/CSS/JS ONLY. Project should be stored and deployed on github.

Tier 2: Same as tier 1, make sure the app is responsive. Develop the font cards via the Google Fonts API using the 8 highest trending fonts at that moment. Implement the search feature. Frameworks can be used. Project should be stored on github and deployed as a functional app.

Tier 2: Same as tiers 1 and 2. Add a user login that offers a dashboard with the user's favorite fonts. These can be added and deleted with the plus/minus button on each font-card. This feature should be enacted with back-end persistance (vs. localStorage, Cache API, etc). Frameworks can be used. Project should be stored on github and deployed as a functional app.

** Chingus must register to the an API key. This is a FREE process. Chingus should also be sure that they are not overusing the API so that they do not limit out. Saving an API call and hardcoding it would be useful in the development phase.
